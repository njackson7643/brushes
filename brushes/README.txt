#This set of scripts can set up polymer brush simulations with the following variations:

- arbitrary salt concentrations, arbitrary salt charges, and the ability to handle to different kinds of salts at once.
- arbitrary polymer brush structure.  arbitrary linear sequence and arbitrary branching sequences.
